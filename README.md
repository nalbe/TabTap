# Windows10 OSK Wrapper

Inspired by the Windows 7 TabTip On-Screen Keyboard, this project is a lightweight wrapper around the default Windows 10 On-Screen Keyboard (`osk.exe`). It enhances usability with additional features while leaving the original executable unchanged.

## Features

- **No modifications to osk.exe:**  
  Operates as a transparent wrapper without altering the original on-screen keyboard executable.

- **Hide on-screen keyboard:**  
  Easily hide the OSK when it overlaps a sensitive window by simply middle-clicking on the tab.

- **System tray integration:**  
  Moves the OSK from the taskbar to the system tray.

- **Lightweight implementation:**  
  Built exclusively using WinAPI, ensuring minimal resource usage.

- **Customizable tab image:**  
  Uses a PNG image with alpha transparency for the tab. This image can be replaced with any preferred image.

- **Autostart capability:**  
  Optionally configure the wrapper to launch automatically with Windows.

## Limitations

- **No animations:**  
  Work on it.
