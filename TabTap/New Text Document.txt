// Inspired by Windows7 TabTip On Screen Keyboard. It's wrapper around default Win10 osk with some lacks and feautures.
// + No changes to osk.exe.
// + The top thing is ability to hide osk in case it overlap other sensitive to focus window you want to interact to by middleclick on tab.
// + Moved from taskbar to tray. 
// + Lightweight, used winapi only.
// + Tab image is a png with alpha. Can be replaced by any preferred image.
// + Autostart ability.
// - Can't directly intercept osk events. Workaround it.
// - No animation. Follows from prev limit.
