**App Description:**  

**Revive the Classic Windows 7 TabTip Experience on Windows 10**  
Tired of the default Windows 10 on-screen keyboard (OSK) cluttering your workflow?
This lightweight utility brings back the beloved Windows 7 TabTip vibe while seamlessly integrating with the native Win10 OSK—no modifications to `osk.exe` required!  

**Features:**  
✅ **Middle-Click to Hide**  
Quickly hide the keyboard with a middle-click on the tab, preventing focus conflicts when interacting with other windows.  

✅ **Discreet Tray Integration**  
No more taskbar clutter! The app runs quietly in the system tray, accessible yet out of the way.  

✅ **Lightweight & Efficient**  
Built purely with WinAPI for minimal resource usage—perfect for low-spec machines or power users.  

✅ **Customizable Tab Icon**  
Replace the default tab image with any PNG (alpha transparency supported) to match your style or theme.  

✅ **Autostart Option**  
Launch the keyboard automatically at system startup for seamless accessibility.  

**Current Limitations:**  
⚠️ **No Direct OSK Event Control**  
Due to system restrictions, the app can’t intercept OSK events directly but employs smart workarounds for basic functionality.  

⚠️ **Simplified Animations**  
Follows the native OSK’s behavior—no flashy transitions, just reliability.  

**Perfect For:**  
- Users nostalgic for the Windows 7 keyboard experience.  
- Anyone needing a clutter-free, focus-aware OSK.  
- Developers/designers who want a lightweight, customizable solution.  

**Keep It Simple, Keep It Functional.**  
No bloat, no fuss—just a refined way to use the Windows 10 OSK with classic convenience.
